This is a Mathematica file. Using it requires a Mathematica subscription. To use, download the folder as a ZIP, extract the folder, and open the .nb file. Necessary information is contained in the notebook.

Alternatively, for those who use Python or want to read the code (Mathematica notebooks don't look pretty on Github), I translated it into Python in Tangela.py.
